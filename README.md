**Name:**	Loden Campbell

**Period:**	1

**Game Title:** Doodle King

## Game Proposal ##

I want to make a mashup of the games Jump King and Doodle Jump. In this new version, there will be a mission to jump through many platforms and shoot monsters to ultimately reach one of your character's loved one. There will be options for your character and who you want to save, and you can get ammo packs along the way so there will be strategy and timing involved with shooting.

Game Controls:

+ Up Arrow Key to shoot your gun
+ Left Arrow Key to move left
+ Right Arrow Key to move right
+ Space button to jump

Game Elements:

+ Continuous level to add the effect of scaling a building
+ Platforms to jump on
+ Gravity so one jump won't bring you to the top
+ Ammo packs will respawn after a certain amount of time
+ A gun to shoot the monsters
+ Monters to block your path upward
+ Monsters take more shots to kill as you move upward
+ A large platform at the top where your loved one will be waiting
+ No fall damage

How to Win:

+ Jump to the very top without being killed by a monster

## Teacher Response ##

**Approved**

Your game description includes enough elements to be interesting and worthy.  Doodle Jump clones I've seen from students have ranged from very basic and not credit worthy to excellent with bonus points.  The most basic ones just spawn random platforms and get faster over time with no real sense of gameplay or purpose.  Not very good.  The best ones have either levels that are purposely designed and have good flow or have an intelligent random generation system that feels right.  The addition of the game elements you mentioned would likely make your game excellent.  Finally, one thing I'm unsure about from your description is the direction the player can fire.  Only upward?  Space jumps (and powers up the jump height) and up arrow fires but it's not clear which direction the shots go.

**5/27/2020 (30 minutes)**

Goal:  Today, I will brainstorm the neccessary classes and interfaces that I need to create my game.

Work accomplished:  I have created classes for the overall game, player world, platforms, player, bullets, and monsters, in addition to the Actor and World class. I plan to have the platforms spawn randomly between the maximum jump distance of jumping right or left from a platform, so no jump is impossible. It has also occured to me that I have to make sure that a platform doesn't spawn directly above a consecutive platform, so the game will still be playable. I will also make it so that bullets only travel upward, and will stop appearing when the ammo count drops to 0. Lastly, I need to find sprites of the player to ensure that it will look like your character is jumping instead of levitating with gravity.
